This is the solution to the tower of hanoi problem. After doing some iterations of this problem ,one can come to a conclusion that the problem is solve by applying the same problem to n-1 disks first, adding the last disk to the target and then adding the rest of the elements to the target. Hence, recursion has been used in both the solutions. My Stack solution only works for 1 test case, but my other solution works for all test cases.
